3.4 decklink
The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic DeckLink devices.

To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you need to configure with the appropriate --extra-cflags and --extra-ldflags. On Windows, you need to run the IDL files through widl.

DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format is uyvy422 or v210, framerate and video size must be determined for your device with -list_formats 1. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz and the number of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all audio channels are bundled in one single audio track.

3.4.1 Options

list_devices
If set to true, print a list of devices and exit. Defaults to false.

list_formats
If set to true, print a list of supported formats and exit. Defaults to false.

bm_v210
If set to ‘1’, video is captured in 10 bit v210 instead of uyvy422. Not all Blackmagic devices support this option.

teletext_lines
If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will be captured from the vertical ancillary data. This option is a bitmask of the VBI lines checked, specifically lines 6 to 22, and lines 318 to 335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines which do not contain teletext information will be ignored. You can use the special all constant to select all possible lines, or standard to skip lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with all receivers. Capturing teletext only works for SD PAL sources in 8 bit mode. To use this option, ffmpeg needs to be compiled with --enable-libzvbi.

channels
Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be ‘2’, ‘8’ or ‘16’. Defaults to ‘2’.

duplex_mode
Sets the decklink device duplex mode. Must be ‘unset’, ‘half’ or ‘full’. Defaults to ‘unset’.

video_input
Sets the video input source. Must be ‘unset’, ‘sdi’, ‘hdmi’, ‘optical_sdi’, ‘component’, ‘composite’ or ‘s_video’. Defaults to ‘unset’.

audio_input
Sets the audio input source. Must be ‘unset’, ‘embedded’, ‘aes_ebu’, ‘analog’, ‘analog_xlr’, ‘analog_rca’ or ‘microphone’. Defaults to ‘unset’.

video_pts
Sets the video packet timestamp source. Must be ‘video’, ‘audio’, ‘reference’ or ‘wallclock’. Defaults to ‘video’.

audio_pts
Sets the audio packet timestamp source. Must be ‘video’, ‘audio’, ‘reference’ or ‘wallclock’. Defaults to ‘audio’.

draw_bars
If set to ‘true’, color bars are drawn in the event of a signal loss. Defaults to ‘true’.
